// In Unit Test at a very low level, what result we should expect from calling a 
//specific function or piece of code

// Functional Test what does our 
//website or app need to do when a user performs some action).

//Unit Test
//A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
//Expect multiplcation(2, 3) to be a number
//Expect multiplcatiion(2, 3) to be equal to 6
//Expect multiplcation("j", 3) to be an error


//A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array 
//that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

//Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be an new array of odd numbers
//Expect concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]) to be [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
// Expect concatOdds([]) to be an error


//Functional Test

//Look at three prompts write out answer in pseudocode
//What should happen if the cart is empty?
//When the user has an empty card, allow button to add more to cart or similar items shown on empty cart page
//What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
//User should see running total with regular price, coupons, taxes, shipping if needed
// Also payment options
//What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
//To optimize code we can add security by Forgot Password link and/or Login Reset link
